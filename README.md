## ‚ö° How It Works
1. User enters a natural language query (e.g., *"Show me the top 5 customers by sales"*).
2. DataGPT converts it into SQL (e.g., `SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_name ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC LIMIT 5;`).
3. The SQL is executed on the database.
4. Results are displayed in a clean, readable table.
